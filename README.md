# OrderRX – Prescription Ordering Web App

OrderRX is a full-stack web application built for a pharmacy to manage recurring prescription orders. It replaces an outdated Excel-based workflow with a structured, web-based dashboard that improves visibility, reduces errors, and enhances staff efficiency.
